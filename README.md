# Python_Block-Diagonal_Matrix_Solver4

Solve the block-diagonal matrix by a new function linsolve_block_diag(blocks, b).

Break the system into sub-systems, and solve each sub-system separately.

Compare the computation time needed to solve a block-diagonal system  𝐴𝑥=𝑏  using linsolve_block_diag(blocks, b) and  np.linalg.solve(A,b).
